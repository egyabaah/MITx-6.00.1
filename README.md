# MITx 6.00.1 on edx in 2020 

## *Emmanuel Gyabaah*

This repo contains my old codes while auditing the above course. It also includes a few coding problems from leet code and codewars

## Notes
This was my first time coding so code, formating and documentation may not be the best. I have actually improved a lot from then since I have been learning and practicing coding continuously from that time.
I have completed other courses since then including:
* CS50X
* Created a flask backend webapp
* Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software (https://www.udemy.com/share/1037N0/)
* Learnt React Native and created a top 25 (App Store) education app in my country
* Currently learning Android through CS194A from Stanford University as at (12/05/2024)

Current Goal:
Find a software engineer job to learn from other experienced engineers and also contribute my skills
